        <div >I added thesse text boxes! they're made in p5.js and drawn on screen rather than using an image. resolution will never be an issue. I wonder if it will affect performance and if it will work on mobile.<br><br>

        here is the link to the rnbo web <a href="/html/web drum machine.html">drum machine</a><br><br>

        I've updated some of the css for the drum machine but theres still more I should do with it.<br><br>

        the background stippling was also made in p5 but its an image that I exported. its only 400 x 400 pixels but its tiled. I think thats more efficient than running more p5 code. its only 5kb.<br>

        <a href="/html/stipple-p5.html">p5.js for the background stippling</a> and a little more<br><br>
        if you dig around a little you can find some other background images or you could just go to <a href="https://github.com/PrimroseOO/website">my github</a><br><br>

        I'm working on a monome that will work in browser. I'm not sure if I can get the SerialOsc beap object to recognize the browser as a device. The way it works right now is a web socket sends messages to a node.js server in terminal which sends udp that max receives with the udpreceive object. I would like to get rid of the node.js server but I'm not sure how.<br><br>
        I've been working through <a href="https://monome.org/docs/serialosc/osc/">this osc reference</a>. all thats left is the map message and /sys/info message. then I need to decide on whether I add degrees and variable brightness.<br><br>

        I fixed the textbox canvas size when the window is resized, removed web monome bew, and adjusted some styling of the drum machine. I can see that the header elements aren't level with each other. I need to figure out why. The textbox on the right sometimes gets cutoff when resizing the window, I'm not sure why.<br><br>

        I added a video, made tonight in jitter, to the music page. I am still working on a name for pe.16. its going to be on my self titled album. I'm working on a page for this upcoming album. I'm super excited to share it!<br><br>

        <div style="width: auto; height: fit-content;">I might figure out how to    do some animation in p5 and add it over here. I'm not sure if there is really a use for this side-panel rn<br><br>
        
        if you zoom in this text and the home button shift to the left ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è and if you zoom in and resize the window the text boxes break ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è<br><br>

        I did fix the zoom and window resizing stuff. I really need to decide on whether I keep this section over here and what to do with it<br><br>
